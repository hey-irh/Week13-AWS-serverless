# Serverless Hackathon

Now that you've had a taste of deploying a serverless API to the cloud, it's time for you to get creative. For today's hackathon, your challenge is to make a RESTful API in AWS and provide data of your choosing in your lambda functions.

Things to keep in mind:

- Don't forget to make a fully fleshed-out plan before you start coding! As with everything else, it'll be a lot easier to code and deploy your API if you've fully sketched out what you want it to do.
- You have free reign! Get as creative as you want; while you use Serverless/AWS to talk to the database and deploy, you can still use your existing JavaScript/Node skills alongside the new tools you learned today. You can interact with existing APIs as well, for example, so you could get data from somewhere else, do something with it in your code, and then serve it via your API.
- For more information on using Node to interact with DynamoDB, see the docs here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/GettingStarted.NodeJs.html
- You don't have to build a front end as well today (we won't stop you if you want to, but that's not part of the brief). The main objective is to get practice setting up a REST API backend that you can interact with using Postman.

Happy hacking!
